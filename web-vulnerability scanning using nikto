The target server according to this lab was the scanme.nmap.org
(Note that this is a port 80 webservice)

To scan a port 443 webservice  one must specify the SSL flag 
i.e 
nikto -h https://nmap.org -ssl

//Launched Nikto using

Application -> Vulnerability Analysis -> nikto 

//To perform the vulnerability scan on scanme.nmap.org

nikto -h scanme.nmap.org

The outcome is as follows:
- Nikto v2.5.0
